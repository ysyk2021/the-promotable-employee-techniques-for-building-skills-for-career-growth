Active listening is a fundamental skill for effective communication. Practice active listening by fully focusing on the speaker, maintaining eye contact, and avoiding distractions. Show genuine interest and empathy, ask clarifying questions, and summarize or paraphrase the speaker's points to ensure understanding. Active listening demonstrates respect, builds rapport, and promotes mutual understanding.

Be mindful of your tone, body language, and nonverbal cues to align your message with your intended meaning.

## 3\. Developing Emotional Intelligence

Cultivate emotional intelligence by practicing self-awareness, recognizing and managing your emotions effectively, and demonstrating empathy towards others. Understanding emotions allows for better communication, conflict resolution, and building positive relationships in the workplace.
